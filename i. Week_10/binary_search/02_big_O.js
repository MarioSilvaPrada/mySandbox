// To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation.

// Big O can give us a high level understanding of the Time or Space complexity of an algortithm. 
// It doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (if is linear, quadratic, constant etc.)

// Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the behavior 
// of an alghorithm when inputs tends towards a particular value or infinity.

// It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an
// algortithm grow as the inputs grow.

// The Time or Space complexity depends only on the algortihm, not the hardware used to run
// the algorothm.
